        "In recent years it is becoming more and more common to find papers that refer to $\\mathcal L_{\\mathcal D}(\\theta)$ as the (log-)likelihood of the data. Although widespread, this is a misuse of the word likelihood. The [likelihood function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function) is a function of the parameter given a fixed dataset. So, $f(x; \\theta)$ is *not* the likelihood of $x$ given $\\theta$. You can either say it is i) the probability mass of an outcome $x$ given a choice of $\\theta$, or you can say it is ii) the likelihood of $\\theta$ given a fixed data point $x$. Whether to use (i) or (ii) depends on what we are fixing: in parameter estimation the data are fixed, so (ii) is preferred; after estimating $\\theta$ we will sometimes use the distribution to make predictions (using a fixed choice of parameter), in such contexts we might prefer (i). The term likelihood was introduced to contrast the quantity $p(x|\\theta)$ with the quantity $p(\\theta|x)$, which is the *posterior* probability density of $\\theta$ after observing $x$ (a quantity that appears in a Bayesian approach to statistics, along with another famous quantity, the prior probability density $p(\\theta)$ of $\\theta$).\n",
